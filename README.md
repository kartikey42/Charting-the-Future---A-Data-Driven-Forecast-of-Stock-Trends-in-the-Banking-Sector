# Charting-the-Future---A-Data-Driven-Forecast-of-Stock-Trends-in-the-Banking-Sector

Charting the Future - A Data-Driven Forecast of Stock Trends in the Banking Sector is a time series forecasting project aimed at predicting stock price movements for leading Indian banksâ€”HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and ICICI Bank. The project utilizes advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques to analyze historical stock data, uncover underlying patterns, and build accurate predictive models.

Key components of this project include:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw stock data for analysis.

2. Stationarity Testing: Using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests to ensure data is suitable for modeling.

3. Seasonal Decomposition: Breaking down time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.

4. Autocorrelation Analysis: Leveraging ACF and PACF plots to inform ARIMA modeling decisions.

5. Forecasting Models: Implementing ARIMA and auto-ARIMA for univariate time series forecasting.

6. Model Evaluation: Assessing accuracy using MAE, MSE, and RMSE metrics.

The goal is to provide a robust, data-driven framework for stock trend forecasting that can assist investors, analysts, and financial institutions in making informed decisions.
